    This configuration class will be used by some activators to estimate
    resource use by pipeline. Additionally some tasks could use it to adjust
    their resource use (e.g. reduce the number of threads).

    For some resources their limit can be estimated by corresponding task,
    in that case task could set the field value. For many fields defined in
    this class their associated resource used by a task will depend on the
    size of the data and is not known in advance. For these resources their
    value will be configured through overrides based on some external
    estimates.
