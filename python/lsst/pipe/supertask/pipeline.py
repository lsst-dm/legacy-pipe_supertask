    (e.g. if configuration needs extra overrides).

    Attributes
    ----------
    taskName : str
        SuperTask class name, currently it is not specified whether this is a
        fully-qualified name or partial name (e.g. ``module.TaskClass``).
        Framework should be prepared to handle all cases.
    config : `pex_config.Config`
        Instance of the configuration class corresponding to this task class,
        usually with all overrides applied.
    taskClass : type or None
        SuperTask class object, can be None. If None then framework will have
        to locate and load class.
    label : str, optional
        SuperTask class object, can be None. If None then framework will have
        to locate and load class.

class Pipeline(list):
    """Pipeline is a sequence of TaskDef objects.

    Pipeline is given as one of the inputs to a supervising framework
    which builds execution graph out of it. Pipeline contains a sequence
    of `TaskDef` instances.

    Main purpose of this class is to provide a mechanism to pass pipeline
    definition from users to supervising framework. That mechanism is
    implemented using simple serialization and de-serialization via
    pickle. Note that pipeline serialization is not guaranteed to be
    compatible between different versions or releases.

    In current implementation Pipeline is a list (it inherits from `list`)
    and one can use all list methods on pipeline. Content of the pipeline
    can be modified, it is up to the client to verify that modifications
    leave pipeline in a consistent state. One could modify container
    directly by adding or removing its elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pipeline : iterable of `TaskDef` instances, optional
        Initial sequence of tasks.
