    Overrides for task configuration need to be applied by activator when
    creating task instances. This class represents an ordered set of such
    overrides which activator receives from some source (e.g. command line
    or some other configuration).

    Methods
    ----------
    addFileOverride(filename)
        Add overrides from a specified file.
    addValueOverride(field, value)
        Add override for a specific field.
    applyTo(config)
        Apply all overrides to a `config` instance.

    Notes
    -----
    Serialization support for this class may be needed, will add later if
    necessary.

        This method is not very type-safe as it is designed to support
        use cases where input is given as string, e.g. command line
        activators. If `value` has a string type and setting of the field
        fails with `TypeError` the we'll attempt `eval()` the value and
        set the field with that value instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        field : str
            Fully-qualified field name.
        value :
            Value to be given to a filed.

        ------
        `Exception` is raised if operations on configuration object fail.
