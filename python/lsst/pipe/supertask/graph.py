"""Module defining quantum graph classes and related methods.

There could be different representations of the quantum graph depending
on the client needs. Presently this module contains graph implementation
which is based on requirements of command-line environment. In the future
we could add other implementations and methods to convert between those
representations.

    """QuantumGraphNodes represents a bunch of nodes in an quantum graph.

    The node in quantum graph is represented by the `PipelineTask` and a
    single `Quantum` instance. One possible representation of the graph is
    just a list of nodes without edges (edges can be deduced from nodes'
    quantum inputs and outputs if needed). That representation can be reduced
    to the list of PipelineTasks and the corresponding list of Quanta.
    This class defines this reduced representation.

    Different frameworks may use different graph representation, this
    representation was based mostly on requirements of command-line
    executor which does not need explicit edges information.
